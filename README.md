## How to use this notebook

The following image shows a diagram of the inputs, outputs and notebooks involved in the data processing required to obtain the scientific results and conclusions of this project.

![DataProcissingDiagram.png](images/DataProcissingDiagram.png)

The Spectral Overlap Files (SOF) calculation notebook (*/notebooks/SOF_calculation*) generates the resulting spectral and total absorption rates (SAR & TAR) in for each of the considered input pigment/stars/planetary atmosphere. The spectral absorption rate (SAR) is saved to spectral overlap files (SOF), while the total absorption rate (TAR, $\gamma_{t}$) is stored in a PANDAS *tar_table_df* dataframe.

The *SOF_calculation*  notebooks uses the *spectral_overlap_functions* library (imported as *sof*) located on `exophot/codes/spectral_overlap_functions.py`

These calculations are already performed, so the SOF files are included in the */output/SOF/*  folder and the notebooks providing the analysis and results figures and tables can be executed directly. If new pigments/stars/planetary atmospheres parameters are included, the *SOF_calculation* notebook needs to be executed as in the instructions indicated on it.
